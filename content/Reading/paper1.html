The work described in this paper relies on three key intuitions:
<ul>
<li>EEG signals recorded while a subject looks at an image convey feature-level
and cognitive-level information about the image content.</li>
<li>
A low-dimensional manifold within the multi-dimensional and temporally varying EEG signals exists and can be extracted to obtain a 1D represen-
tation which we refer to as
EEG features.</li>
<li>
EEG features are assumed to mainly encode visual data, thus it is possible to extract the corresponding image features for automated classification.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Method</h3>

EEG data was recorded while participants were shown sequence of images.

<h4>Steps by step explaination</h4>

<ol>
<li>Using LSTM based encoder, EEG features are extracted. Classification is performed based on image category as target to get classification accuracy</li>
<li>EEG features extracted on above steps are used as target to train the CNN, to get eeg feature representation of images</li>
<li>Image classification is done using features obtained from CNN mentioned in above steps</li>
</ol>

<h4>Automated visual classification: </h4>
Here, EEG data is not used for classification, eeg features are acquired from trained CNN model for images, they are used for classification purposes.
